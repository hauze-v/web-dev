# What is CSS? #
A browser is someetimes called a `user agent`, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. 

CSS can be used for very basic document text styling - for example changing the `color` and `size` of headings and links.

It can be used to create layout - for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

## CSS Syntax ##
CSS is a rule-based language meaning you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. 

Rules open with a `selector` that selects the HTML element that we're going to style.

We then have a set of cury braces { }. Inside those will be one or more `declarations`, which take the form of `property` and `value` pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the propery. 

Get comfortable searching "MDN <insertCSSPropertyHere>" into google whenever you want to know what additional values you can use for a given property.

## CSS Modules ##
As there are so many things you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.

--- CSS SPECIFICATIONS ---
Alll web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or simply "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as W3C, WHATWG, ECMA) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

CSS is no different - it's developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS

New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers or developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement.
