  On <strong>Sunday</strong> <em>January 9th, 2010</em>, a gang of <strong>goths</strong> were spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping center in <em>downtown</em> <strong>Milwaukee</strong>. They were all wearing <em>green</em> jumpsuits and <em>silly</em> hats, and seemed to be having a <strong>whale</strong> of a time. If anyone has any information about this incident, please contact the <strong>police</strong> now.
