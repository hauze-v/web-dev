# HTML Text Fundamentals #
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", 
or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?").

## Heading best practices: ##
Preferably you should use a single h1 per page -- this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.

Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use h3 elements to represent subheadings, followed by h2 elements to represent sub subheadings -- that doesn't make sense 

Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it's necessary . Documents with many levels (i.e. a deep heading hierarchy) become unweildy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.

Without Headings, your page will perform poorly in terms of SEO (search engine optimization)

Users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly, only reading headers. 

Severely visually impaired people often don't read web pages; they listen to them instead. This is done through software called a screen reader.

## Why do we need semantics? ##
We need to make sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance. In this context, the h1 element
is also a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of a "top level heading on a page."
Its' semantic value will be used in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers (as mentioned above).
