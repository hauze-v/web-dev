# Your First Form #
A web form's HTML is made up of one or more `form controls` (sometimes called `widgets`), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form - they are often referred to as `HTML forms`
  The controls (or widgets) can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the <input> element, although there are some other elements to learn about too. 

These form controls (or widgets) can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered (otherwise known as `form validation`), and paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and blind users.
