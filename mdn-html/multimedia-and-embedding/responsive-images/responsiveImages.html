  <!-- Resolution Switching with Different Sizes Example (srcset and sizes attribute) -->
  <img srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w,
               elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
       sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, (max-width: 799px) 800px"
       src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
       alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">

  <!-- srcet defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. 
    1. An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
    2. A space
    3. The image's intrinsic width in pixels (480w). This is the image's real size

    -- sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true -- these are the hints we talked about.
    1. A media condition (max-width:600) -- "when the viewport width is 600px or less"
    2. A space
    3. The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true (480px)
    4. The last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true)
    5. The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order your media conditions

    -- src is still used as a fallback src file for those browsers that don't support srcset

   <!-- Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions (srcset with x-descriptors) -->
  <img srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg,
               elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x,
               elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
       src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg" 
       alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">

  <!-- CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320px and so in this case, sizes attribute is not needed -- the browser simply works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in srcset.
