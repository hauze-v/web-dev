          <strong>Antimagic Cone.</strong> The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the <em>  antimagic field</em> spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.

          <strong>Bite.</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Eye Rays.</strong> The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it. <br>
          <br>
          <em>1. Charm Ray.</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed b the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.
          <br>
          <em>2. Fear Ray</em> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. <br>
          <br>
          <em>3. Telekinetic Ray</em> If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to 30 feetin any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is incapacitated. <br>
          If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.
