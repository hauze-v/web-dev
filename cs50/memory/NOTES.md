The lecture today is differentiating between variables that store an integer value and variables (p) that store the `address` or `pointer` to that integer value. 

The instructor used a nice mailbox demostration example in which one mailbox (int n) contained the value 50 while the other mailbox (var p) contained the ADDRESS of int n, or `pointer` to int n, at which the value 50 can be found.
