Big O notation means "On the order of" and referrs to the efficiency of your algorithm. How good is it on average?

Omega is similar notation for algorithm efficiency, but means: "In the BEST case" how good is the algorithm?

 typedef struct is the syntax for defining your own data structure in C which in my opinion seems quite similar to declaring an object in languages like JavaScript and Java.
