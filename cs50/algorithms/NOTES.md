Big O notation means "On the order of" and referrs to the efficiency of your algorithm. How good is it on average?

Omega is similar notation for algorithm efficiency, but means: "In the BEST case" how good is the algorithm?

 typedef struct is the syntax for defining your own data structure in C which in my opinion seems quite similar to declaring an object in languages like JavaScript and Java. 

 Bubble sorting algorithm uses pair wise comparison and is pretty slow / taxing with an Big O (order of On^2)

 Selection sort algorithm says: find the smallest item between i'th item in array and last item
  Then swap that smallest item with i'th item.

Recursion
  A technique in programming that calls itself, or makes references to itself.
