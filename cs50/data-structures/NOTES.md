# Data Structures # 
With Arrays, you have to store their value up front.

You can use square bracket notation next to a pointer (address allocation) and it will still work

Best practice when allocating memory is to first check if you've gotten back NULL (meaning you're out of memory)

The downside to arrays is that it's a fixed set of memory that will need reallocating memory if you want to add to it

Nodes are used to represent containers in CS and programming, similar to a node in a math graph
