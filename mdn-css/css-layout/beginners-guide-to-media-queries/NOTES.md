# Beginner's guide to media queries #
The **CSS Media Query** gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels." Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. 

In this lesson you'll first learn about the syntax used in media queries, and then move on to use them in a worked example showing how a simple design might be made responsive.
