# Responsive Design #
In the early days of web design, web pages were built to target a particular screen size. If the user had a larger or smaller screen than the designer expected results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to overly long line lengths, and poor use of space. 

As more diverse screen sizes became available, the concept of *responsive web design (RWD)* appeared, a set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.

## Historic website layouts ##
At one point in history you had two options when designiing a website:

  * You could create a *liquid* site, which would stretch to fill the browser window
  * or a *fixed width* site, which would be fixed size in pixels.

As the mobile web started to become a reality with the first feature phones, companies who wished to embrace mobile would generally create a special mobile version of their site, with a different URL (often sometimes like m.example.com, or example.mobl). This meant that two separate versions of the site had to be developed and kept up-to-date.

In addition, these mobile sites often offered a very cut down experience. As mobile devices become more powerful and able to display full websites, this was frustrating to mobile users who found themselves trapped in the site's mobile version and unable to access information they knew was on the full-featured desktop version of the site.
