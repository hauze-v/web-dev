# Responsive Design #
In the early days of web design, web pages were built to target a particular screen size. If the user had a larger or smaller screen than the designer expected results ranged from unwanted scrollbars to overly long line lengths, and poor use of space. 

As more diverse screen sizes became available, the concept of *responsive web design (RWD)* appeared, a set of practices that allows web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. It is an idea that changed the way we design for a multi-device web, and in this article, we'll help you understand the main techniques you need to know to master it.

  * You could create a *liquid* site, which would stretch to fill the browser window
  * or a *fixed width* site, which would be fixed size in pixels.
