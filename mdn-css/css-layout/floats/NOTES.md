# Floats #
Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the `float` property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. 

With the advent of flexbox and grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.

## The background of floats ##
The `float` property was introduced to allow web developers to implement simple layouts involving an image floating inside a column of text, with the text wrapping around the left or right of it. The kind of thing you'd get in a newspaper layout.

But web developers quickly realized that you can float anything, not just images, so the use of float broadened, for example to fun layout effects such as `drop-caps`.

Floats have commonly been used to create entire web site layouts featuring multiple columns of information floated so they sit alongside one another (the default behavior would be for the columns to sit below one another, in the same order as they appear in the source). There are newer, better layout techniques available and so use of floats in this way should be regarded as a legacy technique.

In this article, we'll just concentrate on the proper use of floats.
