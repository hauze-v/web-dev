# Introduction to CSS Layout #
CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window. The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are
  * Normal flow
  * The `display` property
  * Flexbox
  * Grid
  * Floats
  * Positioning
  * Table layout
  * Multiple-column layout

  Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in good shape to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.
