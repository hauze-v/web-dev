# Handling different text directions #
Many of the properties and values that we've encountered so far in our CSS learning have been tied to the physical dimensions of our screen. We create borders on the top, right, bottom, and left of a box, for example. These physical dimensions map very neatly to content that is viewed horizontally, and be default the web tends to support left-to-right languages (e.g. English or French) better than right-to-left languages (such as Arabic).

In recent years however, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) - these different directionaliteis are called **writing modes**. As you progress in your study and begin to work with layout, an understanding of writing modes will be very helpful to you, therefore we will introduce them now.
