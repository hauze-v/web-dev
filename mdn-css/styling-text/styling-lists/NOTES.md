# Styling Lists #
Lists behave like any other text for the most part, but there are some CSS properties specific to lists that you need to know about, and some best practices to consider. This article explains it all.

## A simple list example ##
Throughout this article, we'll look at unordered, ordered, and description lists - all have features that are similar, and some that are particular to their type of list.

## Handling list spacing ##
When styling lists, you need to adjust their styles so they keep the same vertical spacing as their surrounding elements (such as paragraph and images; sometimes called vertical rhythm), and the same horizontal spacing as each other.
